# Blood and Steel

**Blood and Steel** was my second-semester project at S4G School for Games. It is a **3D arena fighting game** where players battle against hordes of enemies. The development time was **10 weeks**, and during this project, I focused on writing **cleaner and more structured code** compared to my previous project, *Tuuli and the Windy Mountain*. While there's still room for improvement, this project marked a significant step forward in my programming skills.
